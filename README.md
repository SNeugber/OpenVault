OpenVault
=========

Assortment of things I want to keep but should be fine to share with the world


Includes:
- C++ implementation of seperating axis theorem
- Java implementation of an immutable queue
- Java Swing UI focused on using standard UI layouts
- Principal component analysis for character recognition (also Java)
- Q Learning implementation in Java
- Variety of python plotting scripts using matplotlib and numpy (...BOXPLOTS!)
- Some matlab scripts for particle-based localization
- A bit of computer vision code (Java again) used for robot control (includes a losely ransac-based object recognition)
